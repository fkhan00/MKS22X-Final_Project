# MKS22X-Final_Project
Daily Log

Friday May 17th, 2019:

We worked on creating an initial menu and a background for our game. We tried 
to find a built-in method of creating a menu but we couldn't find any. The menu
and background we have right now is more of a filler that we will improve on in stage 3.
The starting page for the menu is the starting screen for the actual game but we might
try to make our own later on. Tomorrow we will work on the Bullet and possibly the Player class.
We plan on finish testing for phase 1 by Sunday night.

- Cleaned up methods and how setup/draw works. Will edit later to compensate for more code.
- Created global instance variables for Bullet storage.
- Added shooting mechanic for gun and Bullets.
